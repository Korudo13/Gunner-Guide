/*What I want this to do:
 * 
 * Have an enemy stay behind cover (a separate gameobject / obstacle)
 * 
 * Have enemy move from Point A (behind cover) to Point B (out in the open), aim gun, fire, go back behind cover, and reload
 * 
 * If Player is within range, they will fire all 6 bullets at once.
 * 
 * If all 6 bullets are stopped, they will reload and fire once Gunner has passed (fire at back)
 * 
 * If They see a Magic Bullet while they're aiming, they will fire anyway (no change)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * If there is a BaTarget, in the way, fire anyway (bat will avoid it?)
 * 
 * If there is a BullTarget, wait and load a second shot (can fire two shots in a row?)
 * */
